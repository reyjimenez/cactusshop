I just wanted you to know that I was so happy with the first batch of plants that I bought from you. I went ahead and ordered a second batch much to my husband's chagrin. Thanks!

Received my order of four String of Pearls today. They were all in amazing shape. Couldn't believe it. Whoever packed them sure knew what they were doing. Please pass this on for me. Also, thanks again for all the help you gave me. You can be sure I will be ordering from you again.

I received my order today and just wanted to let you know that the plants are exceptional! The size and the quality--everything. What you see in the photos is exactly what you get. The packaging and labeling--fantastic! Thank you so much.

Your succulent shipment arrived at my house yesterday, with every single plant in beautiful condition. In fact, they were flawless--not a leaf broken-- which I have discovered is not too common in mail-order succulents. I truly appreciate the care in packaging them. I also was impressed by the larger pots with your company name and e-mail address on them--great idea. My favorite of all (other than the succulents), though, were the plant tags. Wow! Tags on each plant with the complete taxonomy and preferred environmental conditions on one side of the tag and cultural notes on the other side gave me all the information I need to help these plants flourish. I've never received such detailed information, specific to the unique cultural needs of every individual plant in a shipment. I have already ordered more of three species that I received yesterday (to do group plantings in larger shallow terra cotta pots), and I can't wait to see them all together.

I recently ordered eight assorted cacti and succulents online. I'm very impressed and extremely satisfied with the size and quality of the plants I received. I couldn't be more impressed with the service you all have provided. I look forward to doing business with you all in the future.

I am so impressed with ya'll, you seem to really care and are so courteous. If I can get my husband to knock out the wall and put in glass I'll have a big order for you. I really appreciate your thoughtfulness and prompt service.
